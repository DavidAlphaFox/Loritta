# ðŸ’­ Loritta's Website Introspections

This document is meant as a instropections about things that I thought while developing Loritta's website.

## Why not use React?

I don't want to code in JavaScript.

## Why not use next.js?

I don't want to code in JavaScript and, in my opinion, next.js is too opinionated.

## Bliss Framework

Bliss is a htmx inspired framework.

While it is heavily inspired by htmx, it is also inspired by other libraries/frameworks.

* Out-of-bounds swaps in htmx are a bit cumbersome. Instead of having a single select and a single target, Bliss lets you customize each selection.
    * This is useful on pages that we want to swap the sidebar entries and the right sidebar, but NOT the left sidebar itself (useful for the commands page, extras page, etc)

TODO: Bliss is still *very* experimental and may be replaced in the future.

Bliss uses a htmx-like syntax
