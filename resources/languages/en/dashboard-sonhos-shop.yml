            - "Contrary to the popular belief, maintaining a large bot is not an easy or cheap task, and somehow we need to have enough income to maintain Loritta. Because, without income, Loritta would not be able to maintain itself and would eventually cease to exist..."
            - "Selling sonhos helps Loritta continue to cheer, help and entertain people around the world! We use the money to cover costs for hosting, taxes, implementing new features, expanding Loritta and other services, salaries, and more."
            - "And with your purchases, you help a Brazilian project to continue to exist and inspire people! Showing the world that Brazilians can also do extraordinary things."
            - "We know it sucks for users who can't afford it, but if we didn't have people who could afford it, Loritta wouldn't be able to be public so that everyone could enjoy its features without paying! However, we are always trying to improve Loritta's economy features so that users without money can have fun with it."

          description:
            - "It depends on the payment method you have chosen! While some methods are pratically instantaneous, some can take days for your payment to be approved. You can see more information and tips about payment methods when you confirm which product you want to buy."
            - "Sonhos are automatically delivered to your account when the payment is marked as approved by the payment platform! But if something unforeseen happens, please contact our support team to solve the problem! Our goal is not to rip you off, but to make you happy."

            - "Selling sonhos helps Loritta continue to cheer, help and entertain people around the world! We use the money to cover costs for hosting, taxes, implementing new features, expanding Loritta and other services, salaries, and more."
            - "There are people who offer sonhos in exchange for money, this is against the Loritta's Terms of Service and you may be banned if you accept the offer! There are several reasons not to buy from third parties: The person can scam you, and you end up losing your money; The sonhos can be from dubious sources, such as, for example, stolen from another user, and you can end up being banned for receiving stolen sonhos; You do not help Loritta by buying from third parties; among others."
            - "While we have already received ideas from users suggesting that it would be great to have an official system for buying and selling sonhos, it is something difficult to implement due to the laws, bureaucracies and taxes on payments in Brazil, which turns something simple into something extremely complicated."

          description:
            - "You can only use a payment method that you are authorized to use. Using a card that you are not authorized to use is fraud, you will be suspended from Loritta and you will not receive a refund!"

          title: "Can I get a refund for the sonhos I bought?"
          description:
            - "No, because it is a virtual product. If you don't have money, I recommend that you save rather than spend just to ask for a refund later because you don't have enough money, so you avoid headaches for us and especially for you."
